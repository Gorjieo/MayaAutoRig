# AutoRig
The first step in my Maya auto-rigger. Uses multiple abstract classes for construction (and eventually selecting through a custom UI). 
Classes will be part of a custom node and construction will be done through MPx commands.
This version creates nurbs curves, renames them, and adds custom attributes. The curves will be used for control handles and their transforms will be used for skeleton construction.
